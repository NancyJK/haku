          Unfolding in the vast expance of space, our universe is a cryptic
          chronicle of galaxies, <br />
          stars, and cosmic phenomena, each a unique enigma waiting to be
          unraveled.

      <h1>Cosmic Phenomena</h1>
      <p>
        Cosmic phenomena are events that occur in the cosmos, or the universe.
        They are associated with celestial bodies like stars, galaxies, and
        nebulae, and can range from common occurrences to rare, spectacular
        events.

          <h3>Astronomy Basics</h3>
          <p>
            Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earthâ€™s
            atmosphere. This includes objects we can see with our naked eyes,
            like the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the stars. It also includes
            objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like
            faraway galaxies and tiny particles.

          <p>
            Since 1957, Earth-orbiting satellites and robotic spacecraft
            journeying away from Earth have gathered valuable data about the
            Sun, Earth, other bodies in the solar system, and the universe
            beyond. Robotic spacecraft have landed on the Moon, Venus, Mars,
            Titan, a comet, and four asteroids, have visited all the major
            planets.

      <h2>Habitable Exoplanets</h2>
      <p>
        Exoplanets, those celestial bodies orbiting stars outside our solar
        system, are intriguing gateways to worlds beyond our own. They offer a
        tantalizing glimpse into the cosmos, revealing a diverse array of
        planets, some of which may even harbor the conditions necessary for
        life. From gas giants larger than Jupiter to rocky planets akin to
        Earth, the discovery of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding
        of the universe and our place within it. As we continue to explore these
        distant worlds, we inch ever closer to answering the age-old question:
        Are we alone in the universe?

      <h2>Our Galaxy</h2>
      <p>
        Our galaxy, known as the Milky Way, is a vast and complex system of
        stars, planets, gas, and dust, all bound together by gravity. Itâ€™s a
        barred spiral galaxy, characterized by a central bar-shaped structure
        composed of stars, with arms that spiral outward. <br />
        The Milky Way is approximately 100,000 light-years in diameter and
        contains more than 100 billion stars, including our own Sun. At the
        center of our galaxy lies a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius
        , which has a mass about four million times that of the Sun.
