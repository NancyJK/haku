        <li>
          There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the
          beaches on Earth. Thatâ€™s at least a billion trillion.
        </li>
        <li>
          A black hole is created when big stars explode. Its gravitational
          force is so strong that nothing can escape from it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The universe has no centre and is constantly expanding (getting
          bigger) every second.
        </li>
        <li>
          A day on Mercury lasts longer than its year! Mercury moves around the
          sun faster than any other planet â€“ making its year the equivalent of
          88 Earth days.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a â€˜dwarf planetâ€™ after 76 years
          classified as the outermost planet in our solar system since its
          discovery in 1930.
        </li>
        <li>
          The universe is thought to be infinite in size, with no known center
          or edges.
        </li>
        <li>68% of the universe is dark energy.</li>
        <li>27% of the universe is dark matter.</li>
        <li>The Milky Way galaxy has an estimated 100 billion stars.</li>
        <li>
          The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old â€“ but thatâ€™s only a third of
          the age of the universe â€“ which is 13.5 billion years old1
